    <h1>Here are some of the things I love! </h1>
    <h2>Cooking</h2>
    <p>Ever since high school, I have loved to cook! Burgers, wings, pastas, steaks you name it and I'm trying to cook it!
    <h2>Football</h2>
    The best sport ever. It literally got me into college and helped me change my life for the better. Those of us with the last name Fieldings really enjoy this one and it's something that is in my blood.
    <h2>Video Games</h2>
    Pokemon, The Legend of Zelda, Call of Duty, Mortal Kombat, and the list goes on! I love video games! They have actually been a big reason on why I picked up software development!
